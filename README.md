Successes: converts pictures to greyscale! Also, got to explore a variety of packages and came up with some interesting ideas for projects. 


Failures: I had issues installing some packages. I think some were not compatible with the current version of node, but I'm going to check back with the TAs soon about others I thought that should have worked. Also, I am not the most familiar with jS.
